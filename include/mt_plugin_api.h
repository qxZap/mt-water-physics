/* Motor Town native plugin API -- what the loader (version.dll) gives a plugin.
 *
 * A plugin is Binaries\Win64\plugins\mt_plugin_<Name>.dll exporting
 *
 *     extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int PluginInit(const MtApi* api);
 *
 * returning 0 on success. The loader calls it once, from its own thread, in
 * alphabetical order of file name. Do the work on a thread of your own;
 * PluginInit should return quickly.
 *
 * The loader owns everything invasive or shared -- the ProcessEvent hook and
 * engine discovery happen exactly once, there. A plugin never patches vtables
 * itself: two hooks on the same slots break one another.
 *
 * Compatibility: fields are only ever appended. Check api->version (and
 * api->size before touching a field added later) and refuse to start if the
 * loader is older than what you need.
